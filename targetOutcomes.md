For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the "Effect of classroom type on learning" part of the results section.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Effect of classroom type on learning

> Pretest accuracy was statistically equivalent in the sparse classroom
condition (M = 22%) and the decorated-classroom
condition (M = 23%), paired-samples t(22) < 1, and
accuracy in both conditions was not different from
chance, both one-sample ts (22) < 1.3, ps > .21. The children’s
posttest scores were significantly higher than their
pretest scores in both experimental conditions, both
paired-samples ts(22) > 4.72, ps ≤ .0001 (Fig. 4). Therefore,
in both experimental conditions, the children successfully
learned from the instruction. However, their learning
scores were higher in the sparse-classroom condition
(M = 55%) than in the decorated-classroom condition
(M = 42%), paired-samples t(22) = 2.95, p = .007; this
effect was of medium size, Cohen’s d = 0.65.
Analysis of gain scores corroborated the results of the
analysis of the posttest scores. Gain scores were calculated
by subtracting each participant’s pretest score from
his or her posttest score. Pairwise comparisons indicated
that the children’s learning gains were higher in the
sparse-classroom condition (M = 33%, SD = 22) than in
the decorated-classroom condition (M = 18%, SD = 19),
paired-sample t(22) = 3.49, p = .002, Cohen’s d = 0.73.
